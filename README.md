For best performance, run in Google Chrome. The game will also load in Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox but extensive testing has not been done on those browsers.

To play the game, you must smash the fruit. In order for the fruit to break, there are a couple of requirements.
* The hammer must be above the fruit. Smashing a piece of fruit from the side doesn't make sense!
* The hammer must come down with a high velocity. Putting the hammer just a bit above the fruit isn't enough to break it!
* The power must be over 75. You have to hit the fruit hard enough to actually break it!

Commands:
* Left mouse click allows you to select the hammer, fruit, fruit pieces, and lightbulb. All of these objects can be moved when selected.
* Pressing shift while holding an object will raise the object higher.
* Pressing spacebar while holding an object will drop that object to the ground. (This includes the light intentionally. It's not realistic but it is humorous.)
* Use L to toggle the light off and on.
